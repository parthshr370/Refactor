Translate the following Ruby code into an equivalent Java class named '{java_class_name}' in the package '{base_package}'.
Ensure the Java code is syntactically correct and maintains the original logic as closely as possible.
Include necessary imports.
ONLY output the raw Java code for the class, including package declaration and imports. Do not include any explanations, introductions, or markdown formatting like ```java ... ```. 

# Additional Instructions:
# - **Exception Handling:** If the translated code calls methods that throw checked exceptions, either wrap the call in a try-catch block (catching specific checked exceptions and potentially wrapping them in a RuntimeException if appropriate) or declare the necessary checked exceptions in the containing method's 'throws' clause. Do not leave checked exceptions unhandled.
# - **Type Safety:** When retrieving objects from Maps or Collections that are expected to be specific functional interfaces (like Consumer, BiConsumer, Function) or other types, perform an 'instanceof' check before casting and using the object.
